# Gatt-test-project
My test project for Ray Gatt, is an orbital simulation.
Use real NASA astronomical data to simulate how the Sun, planets, and Moon move through space over time. Or input your own choice of bodies.


You load up the file.
First you type in "pip install rms-julian" into a terminal.
Then you start running the code.

SIMULATION OPTIONS:
1. 🌌 Load entire Solar System (Sun + planets + Moon)
2. ✍️  Enter bodies manually

Enter your choice [1-2]: _

You have 2 options, use the data for the solar system, from any specified date, or input bodies manually
The solar system data is pulled from NASA, and you have the option of picking which date to use.

If you chose Option 1, enter a date
Enter simulation date (YYYY-MM-DD)
If you choose option 2, Then you enter in the number of bodies. Their masses, sizes, intial positions and velocities.
Set simulation parameters, timestep and duration. Then watch the simulation go.
