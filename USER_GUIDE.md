# Gatt-test-project
My test project for Ray Gatt, is an orbital simulation.
You load up the file.
First you type in "pip install rms-julian" into a terminal.
Then you start running the code.
You have 2 options, use the data for the solar system, from any specified date, or input bodies manually
The solar system data is pulled from NASA, and you have the option of picking which date to use.

Then you enter in the number of bodies.
Then you enter in their masses, sizes, intial positions and velocities.
